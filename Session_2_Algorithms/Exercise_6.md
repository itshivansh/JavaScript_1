# An algorithm for calculating the area of rectangle and square separately.
* Step 1: Start

* Step 2: Declare variable `a`,`b`,`c`,`d`,`e`
           (here a,b are dimensions of rectangle and c is side of square)

* Step 3: Accept values of a,b,c from user.

* Step 4: multiply `a` and `b`

* Step 5: store the result in `d`

* Step 6: multiply c into c

* Step 7: store the result in `e`

* Step 8: Display `d` as `area of rectangle`

* Step 9: Display `e` as `area of square`

* Step 10: Stop
